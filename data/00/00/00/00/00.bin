  |   In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are      |
  |   joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated    |
  |   with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local     |
  |   criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining     |
  |   show for kids and grown-ups alike!                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   What could go wrong?                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor      |
  |   cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous    |
  |   guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the      |
  |   office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job    |
  |   easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy          |
  |   Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into       |
  |   leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   No place to run, and exactly one place to hide.                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or      |
  |   dismemberment.                                                        |
